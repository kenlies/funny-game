## 📖 Topics
  - Game development
  - Teamwork

## 🛠️ Langs/Tools
  - GDScript (very similiar to Python)
  - Godot Engine
  - GIMP (for sprites)

## 🦉 Getting started

***Note that you will need to install Godot Engine***

  1. ```git clone https://github.com/kenlies/funny-game```
  2. Open Godot Engine
  3. Click ```Import``` and set the path to the ```project.godot``` file in the just cloned repo
  4. Click ```Run```
  5. Have funny times!

## 🔨 To improve

Optimize code & improve readability.
Orginize files more thoughtfully.
Make a released version where the Godot Engine installation is not necessary.
